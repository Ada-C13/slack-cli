What are we working on now?

Need to develop a private skeleton method in recipient class that calls the API to load users and channels when the program loads at the CLI

This method should be private and only actually implemented in the child classes?

Here's the flow:
- operator starts the program
- program initializes a workspace
- workspace initialize invokes a method to load users and channels
